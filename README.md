# caseus

An asynchronous Transformice networking library.

This project contains very many packet definitions, a client implementation, a minimal server implementation, a proxy implementation, and more. It however currently does not contain basically any documentation. For my own sake of mind, I have unfortunately focused more on getting things working rather than on docs or tests. I hope to eventually remedy that, but in the meantime, if you need help with anything regarding this library, please do not hesitate to contact me for help. I am reachable on discord at `friedkeenan#9522`; I would love to help you use this library.
